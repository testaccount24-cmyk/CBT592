Sam,

This is another oldie.  The idea behind this was as an aid in
debugging an assembler program.  You could code the DISPLAY macro
at various points to "display" the values of variables or
registers.  The DISPLAY module has to be link-edited with the
program and you have to add a "DD" statement to your JCL.  Once
you got the program working, remove the DISPLAY macros.

There are two pieces to this.  One is the DISPLAY macro, the
other is a module that you have to assemble and link-edit with
the program that is going to use the DISPLAY macro.  The DISPLAY
macro generates the parameter list and then links to the DISPLAY
module.

The comments say it is not re-entrant and it was written way, way
before XA and 31-bit mode.  I found this when looking through
some stuff that is being purged from what is left of my stuff on
the MVS sytem.  It looks like a line in PROC1TBL may not have
come through quite intact.  I think that table is used to
translate out unprintable characters (it has been too long for me
to remember).  I doubt that this is really good for much now, but
it could possible inspire someone to develop something similar.

Note:  I fixed the PROC1TBL the best I could. (SG)
