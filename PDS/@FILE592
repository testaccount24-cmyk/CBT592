//***FILE 592 is from Richard Rice, and contains an assembler       *   FILE 592
//*           program and a macro (both called DISPLAY), which      *   FILE 592
//*           allows the programmer to display registers, fullwords *   FILE 592
//*           and halfwords, etc. so that it is easier to debug     *   FILE 592
//*           your assembler program.                               *   FILE 592
//*                                                                 *   FILE 592
//*           You linkedit the DISPLAY assembler module with the    *   FILE 592
//*           assembler program that you're coding, and to display  *   FILE 592
//*           values from the program, you code instances of the    *   FILE 592
//*           DISPLAY macro in your program.  The result is a       *   FILE 592
//*           display of the quantity, in readable format, so you   *   FILE 592
//*           can debug your program.  When your program is clean,  *   FILE 592
//*           you simply remove the DISPLAY macros.                 *   FILE 592

//*           This is very old code, from the 70s or so.  See       *   FILE 592
